# Better Dpad

A hobby project I made because navigating Android with a D-pad (like on Qin F21 Pro) kinda sucks.

## What it does

It uses the Accessibility Service to add key bindings to make D-pad navigation less annoying — such as tabbing to the first or last focusable element on screen, or jumping to the FAB without tabbing around forever.

There's also some per-app stuff baked in for a handful of apps I personally use (Google Maps, Google Messages, etc.).

## To use

1. Install the APK (or compile it from source code yourself if you don't trust it)
2. Open the app and tap the banner to grant it permission to accessibility service
3. Configure your key bindings in the app

## Disclaimer

This is purely a personal project I work on in my spare time. I'm not looking to add support for specific apps on request — feel free to fork away!
